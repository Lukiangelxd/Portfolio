# Hannah McEvoy's Portfolio
## Description

This portfolio is to represent theprojects that I have done throughout my course and shows to future recruiters what I am capable of doing. Currently I have a navbar that has links to an About section, a work section (that is empty as of now) and a contact section. To make this portfolio possible I have used only HTML and CSS.
